    About Me
My name is Rohan Menon and I am a softmore attending Skyline High School. I play tennis, chess, and participate in HOSA and MUN. My favorite subject is biology and I will
probably pursue a career in medicine. I am also a big fan of music and I want to start creating some on a digital music workstation. A goal I have this year is making
the Varsity team for tennis in the spring. I also want to finish the year with great grades, hopefully all A's.
